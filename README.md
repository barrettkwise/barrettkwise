I am a highschool entry level programmer looking for internships and commisions.
I have a growing knowledge of Python and HTML/CSS.
Contact me via email at @barrettkwise@gmail.com.
My schedule is varied as I have to keep up with school work, but I am willing work when ever I have time.
To see my skill level, I have linked my work from school and what I have done in my free time.
